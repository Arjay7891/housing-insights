# Meeting with City First Bank

City First Bank is a local DC bank that focuses on community-focused lending, including to affordable housing developments. They are very interested in the project, and would like to arrange a meeting with 3-4 people from the bank and a few people from our development team, to hear about their needs and interest in the project.

As of now we'll need to hold this during a regular workday. If you are interested in being involved in the discussion please fill out the Doodle poll. If you can't make any of the times, still fill out the poll and I will talk to the bank about additional times we could hold the interview (e.g. our Tuesday work sessions). Meeting will be held near 14th and U St NW (the bank office).
