  <p><strong>Latest News:</strong>
      We will be holding a weekly come-if-you-can work session every Tuesday evening. During January, in weeks with a Thursday Code for DC Hacknight we will hold both sessions. You can come to one or both, with the Tuesday session focusing on coding in teams and Hacknights focused on new member recruitment and coordination with other projects. We will reevaluate at the end of the month whether this schedule continues to make sense.

  <strong>Snack/Drink Signup</strong>: Tuesday work sessions are BYO-dinner, but if we rotate drink/snack responsibilities each week it'll make work sessions that much more enjoyable! <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LMS-DvR8-1zJVYjM21s0AXHfU3l42ZdOUDslhnrAxcA/edit?usp=sharing">Sign up here</a> to bring something to an upcoming session.
