# Project Summary
We want to help DC government officials and affordable housing advocates better spend the time and money available for affordable housing preservation. We will do this by providing better access to data and analysis for both the current affordable buildings and the neighborhoods they are part of.

## What is Affordable Housing Preservation?
Beginning in the 1970's, most affordable housing is owned privately. Both the federal and DC government provide subsidies to these owners in exchange for offering reduced rents to eligible low income residents. These subsidies take different forms depending on the building, but they can be direct rent subsidies, long-term low interest loans, or tax credits. Buildings last a long time, so even if a particular program has been ended existing contracts are still active.

Private owners can choose to either renew their contracts or stop participating (usually when contracts expire). If they stop participating, DC loses affordable housing that low income tenants need; often when the property was participating in an expired program the subsidy money cannot be redirected elsewhere and there is less funding available for supporting affordable housing.

Affordable Housing Preservation is the process of getting these owners to continue participation in these programs to keep units available to low income tenants. Usually this is done by refinancing and rehabing the property as a way to renew the incentives, or by legal action. DC renters get the right of first refusal through the [Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA)](http://dc.urbanturf.com/articles/blog/first-timer_primer_what_is_the_right_of_first_refusal/7484), or the DC government can purchase it on their behalf with the [District Opportunity to Purchase Act (DOPA)](http://dhcd.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/dhcd/publication/attachments/2016%20DOPA%20Guideline-Fact%20Sheet.pdf). The DC Government has allocated [over $100M per year](https://wamu.org/news/16/10/13/bowser_says_100_million_for_affordable_housing_is_historic_but_is_it_enough) to spend on affordable housing, including preservation, as well as other government agencies like the [DC Housing Finance Agency (HFA)](http://www.dchfa.org/DCHFAHome/Developers/ProgramDescriptions/MortgageRevenueBonds/tabid/134/Default.aspx).

It's important to also note that one building can participate in multiple programs, making complete data on DC's affordable housing challenging.
